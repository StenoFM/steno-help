# Why doesnâ€™t this episode have a transcript?

[Steno.fm](http://steno.fm) relies on transcripts provided by the publisher of the podcast. If we don't detect a `<podcast:transcript>` tag in the RSS feed, we don't have any text to display. 

If you are a listener who would like a podcast to be transcribed, please contact the publisher directly. 

If you are a publisher who would like to like to add transcripts to your RSS feed, [read our guide](https://www.notion.so/How-do-I-add-transcripts-to-my-RSS-feed-10cc42aadd424ed1ad10cad7c57c873f).
