## Account creation

Steno.fm has recently been released to preview our transcript-centric podcast interface. We’re focused on testing and improving the core features of the app, and creating accounts is not a priority at this time If you’re interested in using Steno.fm, [subscribe to our newsletter](https://blog.steno.fm/#/portal/signup) to stay up-to-date with our progress.

## Missing transcript

Steno.fm doesn’t transcribe anything ourselves. We rely on podcasters to provide their own transcripts in their RSS feeds. Many podcast hosts don’t support the [`<podcast:transcript>`](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/docs/1.0.md#transcript) tag yet, and the podcaster may have transcripts available via their website. To inquire further, please contact the podcaster directly.
