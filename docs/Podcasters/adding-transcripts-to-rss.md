# How do I add transcripts to my RSS feed?

Until recently, there hasn't been an easy way to share transcripts. But thanks to the contributors to the [podcast namespace](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace), there's a new [<podcast:transcript>](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/docs/1.0.md#transcript) tag that you can include in your RSS feed. [Steno.fm](http://steno.fm) relies on this tag to display transcripts.

[Several podcast hosts have already adopted it](https://blog.steno.fm/hosts/) and if your current host doesn't support it, we recommend that you encourage them to support the new tag or take your business elsewhere.
