# Why can’t Steno.fm play my episode?

If listeners are having difficulty playing your podcast on [Steno.fm](http://steno.fm), there are a few potential solutions to try. If you run into an issue other than the ones below, please reach out via email.

## Ensure that your files are available via HTTPS

Browsers like Chrome refuse to serve mixed HTTP and HTTPS content. When [Steno.fm](http://steno.fm)—a site served over HTTPS—requests an HTTP resource, Chrome will try to retrieve it with HTTPS. If the feed refuses HTTPS connections, the audio won't play.
